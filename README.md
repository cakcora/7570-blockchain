# General Information

## Description

Over the last couple of years, Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the Blockchain technology that forms the basis of Bitcoin have witnessed an unprecedented attention. As Blockchain applications proliferate, so does the complexity and volume of data stored by Blockchains. Analyzing this data has emerged as an important research topic, already leading to methodological advancements in the information sciences. Although there is a vast quantity of information available, the consequent challenge is to develop tools and algorithms to analyze the large volumes of user-generated content and transactions on Blockchains, to glean meaningful insights from Blockchain data. The objective of the course is to train students in data collection, cleaning and modeling for Blockchain Data Analytics on public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will also cover the Libra blockchain of Facebook.

This class will be taught as a seminar class, and will primarily consist of reading, reviewing, and presenting research papers.

A specific problem will be assigned to each group, and the resulting Python/R code will be incorporated in the Manitoba Blockchain tool at Github/cakcora/chainoba. Students will hold bi-weekly project progress meetings.

**This class requires extensive reading.** In addition to the book chapters, more than 40 research papers, surveys and articles will be read by each student. Every week, students will write a summary of the assigned papers. In addition, there will be a Data Science project where students will implement algorithms. **Please make sure that you have given enough thought to these requirements.**

**Reading summary (text from N. Papernot)**

A summary of assigned reading is due each class (starting from week 2 and onwards), one page for each assigned paper. A PDF copy should be emailed before the beginning of class. The summary should cover the following: (a) what did the papers do well?, (b) where did the papers fall short?, (c) what did you learn from these papers?, and (d) what questions do you have about the papers?

**Paper presentation**

Starting from week 2, a team of students will present the papers assigned for reading each week. The team may choose an appropriate format (e.g., slides, interactive demos or code tutorials, ...) for this presentation with the only requirements being that the presentation should (a) involve the class in active discussions, (b) cover all papers assigned for reading, and (c) last no more than 1h30mn including discussions.

**Class notes**

Another team of students will be charged with writing notes synthesizing the content of the presentation and class discussion. This document will be maintained on Chainoba in Markdown files.

**Research projects**

Students will work on a course-long research project. Each project will be presented in the form of a poster in the last class. The software code will be contributed to the open source Chainoba project on Github.

**Prerequisites**

Students need to be able to code in the statistical computing language R or/and Python.

The course assumes students already have a basic understanding of Machine Learning and Data Mining. Undergraduate students will be admitted only if they have taken such a course.

**Expectations and Goals**

Students will be able to achieve the following learning objectives at the completion of the course.

- Learn the history of digital currencies and problems that prevented their adoption. What are the real-life use cases of Blockchain? How Blockchain differs from earlier solutions?
- Learn the concepts of consensus and proof-of-work in distributed computing to understand and describe how blockchain works.
- Learn data models for addresses, transactions and blocks in cryptocurrencies and Blockchain platforms.
- Use Python and R to extract Blockchain blocks and store the transaction network on Bitcoin, Ripple, IOTA and Ethereum Blockchains.
- Model weighted, directed multi-graph Blockchain networks and use graph mining algorithms to identify influential users and their transactions.
- Predict cryptocurrency and crypto-asset prices in real time.
- Extract and mine Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Course Materials

## Required Materials

The book &quot;Blockchain: Fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science (Cambridge University Press)&quot; by Cuneyt Gurcan Akcora, Yulia R. Gel and, Murat Kantarcioglu will be provided in e-copy and used as the course book.
